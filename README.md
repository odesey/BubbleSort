BubbleSort
==========

A skeleton app and test for the bubble sort algorithm.

# Install

1. Fork this repo
2. git clone your own copy to your projects folder.
3. cd ~/projects/BubbleSort

# TODO

Use this to convert your work in progress from earlier to implement a sorting algorithm.

If you've previously had something like this:

to_sort = [5, 1, 4, 5, 8]

You need to replace all occurences of to_sort with self, if you are going to package your code inside of a custom Array article.

Secondly, you need to finish your implementation so that the test passes!

# To run

```ruby my_amazing_test.rb```

# Submission

Once you're done
